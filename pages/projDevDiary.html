                        <div class="list-text">Excited to be starting the group project! I am in a group with 3 people (Molly, Min and I), and our topic will be about intergenerational trauma. Because there are only 3 people in our group, we will have to be mindful of the scope. This week we went over scrollytellying examples and I started having a better idea of what our project might look like. We also presented our pitch during class. Below, in order from left to right: Min, Molly, and me.</div>

                        <div class="list-text">I am not in charge of the research or script, so I am waiting on my group members to see what they land on in terms of the content. I will provide feedback on the content, and hopefully we can move forward with the script and visuals. There are two main methods of inheriting trauma, and we are having a meeting soon to discuss which one we’d like to focus on, and how in depth we are presenting the topic. We will have to adjust our timeline to accommodate for this though, because we planned to finish scripting and research much earlier than what panned out. 
                        In terms of the visuals, I populated the moodboard with inspiration, ranging from UI examples to 3D modelling and 2D illustration styles. Our scrollytelly will have a mix of 2D and 3D elements. We decided to pursue a visual style for our scrollytelly that was inspired the comic “Here”, where the whole story takes place in the same location, but at different time points, with overlayed panels over the static background. See the example below; its much easier to see the effect visually.</div>

                        <div class="list-text">We intend to have a scrollytelly that has the same static environment, but as you scroll, new overlays and boxes will appear over the environment, bringing new information. The environment will probably be 2D, and the overlays will have 3D models. 

                        I am also responsible for putting together the design document, and I am planning on typing everything out after we finalize some details. The draft we submit may be missing some stuff but we should have a rough draft ready for the due date. I will be typing it out on Google docs before putting it onto our shared Figma file for nicer formatting.
