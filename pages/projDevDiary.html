Because there are only 3 people in our group, we will have to be mindful of the scope. This week we went over scrollytellying examples and I started having a better idea of what our project might look like. We also presented our pitch during class. Below, in order from left to right: Min, Molly, and me.</div>

                        <div class="list-text">I am not in charge of the research or script, so I am waiting on my group members to see what they land on in terms of the content. I will provide feedback on the content, and hopefully we can move forward with the script and visuals. There are two main methods of inheriting trauma, and we are having a meeting soon to discuss which one we’d like to focus on, and how in depth we are presenting the topic. We will have to adjust our timeline to accommodate for this though, because we planned to finish scripting and research much earlier than what panned out. 
                        In terms of the visuals, I populated the moodboard with inspiration, ranging from UI examples to 3D modelling and 2D illustration styles. Our scrollytelly will have a mix of 2D and 3D elements. We decided to pursue a visual style for our scrollytelly that was inspired the comic “Here”, where the whole story takes place in the same location, but at different time points, with overlayed panels over the static background. See the example below; its much easier to see the effect visually.</div>

                        <div class="list-text">We intend to have a scrollytelly that has the same static environment, but as you scroll, new overlays and boxes will appear over the environment, bringing new information. The environment will probably be 2D, and the overlays will have 3D models. 

                        I am also responsible for putting together the design document, and I am planning on typing everything out after we finalize some details. The draft we submit may be missing some stuff but we should have a rough draft ready for the due date. I will be typing it out on Google docs before putting it onto our shared Figma file for nicer formatting.

                        <div class="list-text">We are continually refining our script and storyboard as we move along. I have reviewed the iterations of storyboards by both Min and Molly, and arrived at the conclusion that developing our entire scrollytelly may not be feasible given our timeline. Molly’s script was quite simple, but there were more details in Min’s iteration. We will need to move forward with finding a balance between the two. We will need to check in with Alex to see if we can develop certain portions of the story instead of the whole thing. It would make sense to develop the introduction to give some context, and then some other part later on. Molly is away so I had a meeting with Min to discuss this, but we will need to touch base altogether when Molly is available. We also have to consider the 3D elements in our project; a goal we initially set was to create nice 3D assets as a way to practice our 3D skills so we have to ensure that we find a place for that in the parts of the scrollytelly we do intend to develop. Below are the storyboards Min and Molly created:</div>

                        <div class="list-text">This week is reading week so we have a bit less work (or at least less work on my end). Although we planned out roles and responsibilities quite early on, I feel that because we are a smaller group, our responsibilities are a bit more fluid. I will have to go back and change that chart later on when I am creating the final design doc. It might help to have the “Lead”, “Contribute” and “Consult” categories for each role and each person. My next steps are to look further into the scrollytellying software that I will be using for development of our project. I will be meeting with Min and probably Molly early on the weekend again.</div>

                        <div class="list-text">Reading week is over! But, Molly and I are both sick… hopefully we recover soon, because we really need to get down to business and start with production. We had to adjust the timeline to account for a number of changes to our project. First off, we decided to have the background elements (static scenery of the living space) be 3D modelled instead of purely hand-drawn. After they are crudely modelled, which is a task that was designated to Molly, Min will be going in to trace over the scene and add in small details and the characters. The second change is that I decided we needed an intermediate storyboard stage - we didn’t have the storyboards set up in a way that indicated the script and actions that were happening at the same time. Below is a screenshot of the new storyboard format with a chart, with Min’s previous storyboards.</div>

                        <img src="../images/DDwk03_01.png" class="img-container">

                        <div class="list-text">Min will be changing their final storyboards to fit this format and fill out the table where possible, and I will be going in to fill out any missing actions or unaccounted elements that need actions. We also decided to develop the introduction, a bit of the part on epigenetics, and the stress response part of our initial storyboard. Molly will be editing the script for the last time and simplifying the language to better fit the simplified visuals (we have decided that most of the scientific stuff - hormones, proteins, etc.- will be pretty low fidelity and blobby). Alex has suggested we be specific about the reading level, so we will explicitly aim for grade 8 reading level. I think I will change that in the design doc too. In terms of the scrollytellying software, I decided on Webflow because it seems to be the best option for customization and has a decent amount of support online, plus it is free. I was initially going to start on a prototype in Figma, but upon consideration and with advice from Alex, we are switching gears and moving directly into Webflow for the prototype. This should offset the development crunch and learning curve at the end of the project (although it already does feel like a crunch haha..). I will aim to make a really rough prototype by next week with placeholder images where necessary, just to test out the interactivity and to learn how to use Webflow. The start of our prototype currently looks like this (see below).</div>

                        <div class="list-text">I have also started on the style guide, which is still quite rudimentary and will be subject to change as I develop the prototype. Below you can see the rough style guide and the title card I drafted on Figma.</div>

                        <div class="list-text">Lots of work to do moving forward, we are jumping into production soon/now! The timeline was adjusted to accommodate for a longer preproduction section. I wanted to be more involved in the 3D modelling, but given that development is a big task, I probably won’t be doing much 3D. But, I might contribute to some of the assets later on (i.e. next week) while Molly takes care of the bulk of it this week. We will see… </div>
