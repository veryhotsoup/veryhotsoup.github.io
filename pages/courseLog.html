I have heard the terms "backend", "frontend", and "full-stack" thrown around, but never really knew what they meant. Knowing these terms and understanding web dev a bit better is definitely an asset, especially to communicate with developers more efficiently and accurately.</div>

                        <div class="list-text">Storyboarding is super important! I find that storyboarding is very fun, although I have little knowledge of how to do it properly. I've learned today the importance of arrows in storyboarding, and how helpful having accompanying descriptive text is. In my experience at my summer internship at UHN, I've realized just how important preproduction is (and how much time it takes to plan everything well before moving into production), and today's lecture reinforced this.</div>

                        <div class="list-text">It was quite valuable seeing everyone's approach to storyboarding, as this is something I am not skilled at and have not properly learned. There are a few tips I would like to keep in mind moving forward, such as using different colours for different arrows (camera movement vs scene action), colour-coding the text, and spatial separation of the script and the storyboard descriptions. I also learned quite a bit about how to storyboard interactivity! I still have much to improve on.</div>
