I have heard the terms "backend", "frontend", and "full-stack" thrown around, but never really knew what they meant. Knowing these terms and understanding web dev a bit better is definitely an asset, especially to communicate with developers more efficiently and accurately.</div>

                        <div class="list-text">Storyboarding is super important! I find that storyboarding is very fun, although I have little knowledge of how to do it properly. I've learned today the importance of arrows in storyboarding, and how helpful having accompanying descriptive text is. In my experience at my summer internship at UHN, I've realized just how important preproduction is (and how much time it takes to plan everything well before moving into production), and today's lecture reinforced this.</div>

                        <div class="list-text">It was quite valuable seeing everyone's approach to storyboarding, as this is something I am not skilled at and have not properly learned. There are a few tips I would like to keep in mind moving forward, such as using different colours for different arrows (camera movement vs scene action), colour-coding the text, and spatial separation of the script and the storyboard descriptions. I also learned quite a bit about how to storyboard interactivity! I still have much to improve on.</div>

                        <div class="list-text">Today's class was very useful in getting me to think about scrollytelling and the practical considerations of designing a linear narrative for this format. It is good to think about how the user will interact and perceive the scrolling format, especially since my group project which will probably use horizontal scrolling. We want to avoid scrolljacking!! Additionally, other considerations such as designing the script and visuals at the same time would be a good idea to avoid circling back to correct either aspect too many times. I will need to discuss with my group members a bit more to finalize how we want to make the actual scrolly, but I think we will probably avoid coding it ourselves and use a free software such as Flourish.</div>

                        <div class="list-text">We learned about some intro Javascript stuff today. Most of this stuff is completely new to me, and I did not add any JS elements into my course website like some of the other classmates. I was a bit confused during the tutorial but once things started working, it was easy to see how powerful Javascript can be. I will definitely go over the tutorial once it is posted and take notes on it. The hover and popup modals are useful and might be used in our group project.</div>
